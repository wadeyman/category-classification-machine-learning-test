Learning more about scikit learning

Supervised text classification problem, and the goal is to investigate which supervised machine learning methods are best suited to solve it.

Given a new text description incoming we want to assign it to one predetermined categories. The classifier makes the assumption that each new text is assigned to one category. This is a multi-class text classification problem
